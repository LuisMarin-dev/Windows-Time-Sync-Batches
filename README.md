# Windows-Time-Sync-Batches
Windows batch files that will sync your PC's time to the windows time server.


These files are easy to use, just double click on them and let them do their thing.

I know most PCs now have their time automatically updated, but some older devices can have issues when it comes to updating their time and date. These are for those who haven't found a long term solution.

I'm open to corrections/improvement suggestions.

Hope it helpsüòÅ
